# Photo Timekeeping Mobile App - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This Product Requirements Document outlines the development of a comprehensive photo-based time tracking system designed for field workers and client project visibility. Building upon an existing Expo-based timeclock application, this system requires photographic documentation at key time record events and provides clients with real-time project progress updates through a dedicated mobile application.

**Current Status:** Foundation application exists with core timekeeping, photo verification, and California labor law compliance features implemented.
