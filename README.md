# Photo Timekeeping Mobile App - Complete Project Documentation

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for transforming an existing Expo-based timeclock application into a full-featured photo-based time tracking system with client project visibility. The project builds upon a solid foundation of photo-verified timekeeping, GPS-based job site detection, and California labor law compliance.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

### Current Foundation
Your existing timeclock app already provides:
- ✅ Photo-verified clock in/out with react-native-vision-camera
- ✅ GPS-based job site detection (100m radius)
- ✅ California labor law compliance (8h daily = 1.5x, 12h = 2x, 40h weekly = 1.5x)
- ✅ Lunch break tracking with photo requirements
- ✅ Role-based authentication (employee/supervisor/admin)
- ✅ Local data persistence with AsyncStorage
- ✅ Timecard history and supervisor approval workflows

### Planned Enhancements
The documentation outlines adding:
- 🆕 Client-facing mobile app for real-time project visibility
- 🆕 Enhanced work cycle and task tracking
- 🆕 Backend infrastructure with Node.js/MongoDB/AWS S3
- 🆕 Real-time photo sync and push notifications
- 🆕 Multi-tenant architecture for enterprise deployment
